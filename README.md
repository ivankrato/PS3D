# PS3D
Pseudo 3D game engine. Made as a school project. Can render walls, sprites, some information text on screen and animate them. Also checks for collisions.  
  
I included an example of what it can do and also an example game - Maze3D. It should be easy to extend the project and create some games - from what comes to my mind Pacman or Bomberman clones should work well.
  
Uses SFML for showing the pixels.  
  
  
Some textures are downloaded from http://opengameart.org
